Perform some basic setup of my computer when I reinstall (or perform a major
upgrade on) the OS.

keylayout.pl
   Move my custom Dvorak keyboard layouts to the system directories, and
   register them in the rules files. Newer versions of Ubuntu will reread
   these immediately; other distros may require a logout

   Run -h for help. Requires root priviledges

apache.sh
   Install and set up the Apache server. Requires root priviledges

applekeyboard.sh
   The default settings for the Apple Aluminum keyboard are a bit off (F-keys
   default to Fn mode). Fix them. Requires root priviledges

crontab.sh
   Put a couple things in my crontab. Only works if the crontab doesn't
   already exist

setup.sh
   And the wrapper for all the above. Requires root priviledges
